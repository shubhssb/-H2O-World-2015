1. Understand Model Complexity
Model size depends on features
Model size is independent of number of rows or training time


2. Establish a Baseline on Holdout Data
Develop a feel for the problem and the holdout performance of the different models


3. Inspect Models in Flow (Notebook-style open-source UI for H2O)
If model is wrong(wrong architecture, response, parameters, etc.), cancel it
If model is taking too long, cancel and decrease model complexity
If model is performing badly, cancel and increase model complexity


4. Use Early Stopping (On by default for H2O)
Saves tons of time
Use Flow to inspect model
arno-candel-h2o-use-early-stopping5. Control Scoring Overhead
Validation data determines scoring speed and early stopping decision


6. Use N-fold Cross-Validation
Estimate your model performance well


7. Use Regularization
Overfitting is easy, generalization is art
arno-candel-h2o-use-regularization8. Perform HyperParameter Search
Parameters to tune: hidden dropout ratios, input dropout ratios, adaptive rate, etc.
Focus on just finding one of the many good models


9. Use Checkpointing
Checkpointing enables fast exploration


10. Tune Communication on Multi-Node
Know your "target ratio of communication overhead to computation" value
